# **Catena-X Policy Profile**

**What is it?**
Catena-X has created a set of well-known rules (policies) for sharing data within its network, called the Dataspace. These rules were previously described in different formats.

**Whatâ€™s new?**
With the latest update (Release 2025-09), there is now a clear and standardized way (using JSON Schemas) for Dataspaces to define and share their own policy profiles.

**Key Component: The Constraint Object**
The Constraint object is a building block in the Dataspace Protocol. It is used in important messages that help companies create legally binding data exchange agreements.

This folder provides:

- The necessary technical files (JSON schemas)
- A context file (JSON-LD)
- Examples of common policies and constraints

**About CX-0152 Policy Constraints**
The CX-0152 document explains how to use these constraints in data access and usage policies. Until the official CX-0152 standard is published, this folder and its files serve as the main reference.

**In summary:**
Catena-X now offers a clearer, standardized way to define and use data sharing policies, making it easier for companies to set up legal agreements for data exchange.
